                            <p class="text">The stunning Lyngen Alps are located in the Arctic Circle and encompass a mountain range that stretches for 90 kilometers to the border with Sweden.</p>
                            <p class="text">The area is covered in fjords, glaciers, and rivers and you will find soaring peaks as well as scenic gorges.</p>
                            <p class="text">Popular pastimes in the Alps include dog sledding or signing up for a snow safari, and there is also a high chance of seeing the northern lights here.</p>
                            <p class="text">Skiing and rock climbing are also top activities in the Lyngen Alps and the highest peak named Jiekkevarre sits at 1,833 meters.</p>
