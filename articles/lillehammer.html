                                <p class="text">The Lillehammer region has a special place in the hearts of many sports fans, thanks to the Winter Olympics in 1994 â€“ one of the largest and most successful sporting events in modern Norwegian history.</p>
                                <p class="text">
                                    Many of the Olympic arenas are still in use and open to visitors, making the region a popular destination for winter sports enthusiasts. In the winter season between November and April, there are plenty of opportunities for both cross-country and alpine skiing.
                                </p> <p class="text"> 
                                    The charming and historically important buildings in the city of Lillehammer serve as the backdrop for a modern and vibrant shopping environment. The town also has a rich offering of museums and cultural centres, such as Maihaugen, Lillehammer Art Museum, and the Norwegian Olympic Museum. 13 kilometres outside of the city centre lies Hunderfossen Family Park, with more than 50 activities and attractions for all ages.</p>
