                            <p class="text">Tromsø, a cool 400km north of the Arctic Circle, is northern Norway’s most significant city with, among other superlatives, the world’s northernmost cathedral, brewery and botanic garden. Its busy clubs and pubs – more per capita than in any other Norwegian town – owe much to the university (another northernmost) and its students. </p>
                            <p class="text">In summer, Tromsø’s a base for round-the-clock, 24-hour daylight activity. Once the first snows fall, the locals slip on their skis or snowshoes, head out of town and gaze skywards for a glimpse of the northern lights.</p>
